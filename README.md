hea_Java is the implementation of Huffman Encoding Algorithm. 
HEA has nearly 50% compression ratio. It compress text properly yet, i'll develop it further(if i get time :D).
Suggetions and contributions are welcomed.

How to run:
	Compile the source files using any Java IDE (i used netbeans) 
	You can run it inside the IDE after compilations or
	You can create executable JAR file and run it using cmd.
